# pdesolver

A simple implementation of the finite element method for solving parabolic partial differential equations.

The solver supports 1D and 2D meshes. For 2D meshes triangles are used, generated by the JTS Topology Suite (https://github.com/locationtech/jts)
The boundary conditions are currently limited to $f'(x) = 0$ if $x$ on boundary.

In galerkin.basefunctions the nodal base functions are defined split up into the different regions which later make up one element.

The Element class provides a basic body for calculating the stiffness matrix.

## Formulation of the pde

The PDE must be directly defined in the weak form for the solver to function.

The solver implicitly assumes fixed boundaries of the regions and moves the time derivative out of the term.

For example in the heat equation:

$$
\Delta u = \frac{d}{dt}u
$$

Transforms into the weak form

$$
-\int \nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \int \frac{du}{dt} v 
$$

$$
-\int \nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \frac{d}{dt} \int u v
$$

## Solver

Thus in the end a linear system of the form $M\frac{du}{dt} = K u$ is solved using gauss elimination (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination#Pseudocode).
The resulting ODE is solved using RK4.

## Example
The Main.java is an example for 2D heat equation on a simple square.
